---EXERCISE 2: Accessing Multiple Tables with Implicit Joins---

--- Perform an implicit cartesian/cross join between EMPLOYEES and JOBS tables.---

select * from employees, jobs;

---Retrieve only the EMPLOYEES records that correspond to jobs in the JOBS table.---

select * from employees, jobs where employees.JOB_ID = jobs.JOB_IDENT;

---Redo the previous query, using shorter aliases for table names.---

select * from employees E, jobs J where E.JOB_ID = J.JOB_IDENT;

---Redo the previous query, but retrieve only the Employee ID, Employee Name and Job Title.---

select EMP_ID,F_NAME,L_NAME, JOB_TITLE from employees E, jobs J where E.JOB_ID = J.JOB_IDENT;

---Redo the previous query, but specify the fully qualified column names with aliases in the SELECT clause.---

select E.EMP_ID,E.F_NAME,E.L_NAME, J.JOB_TITLE from employees E, jobs J where E.JOB_ID = J.JOB_IDENT;
