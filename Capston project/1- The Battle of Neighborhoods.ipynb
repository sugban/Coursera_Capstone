    "The purpose of this Project is to help people in exploring better facilities around their neighborhood. \n",
    "It will help people making smart and efficient decision on selecting great neighborhood out of numbers of \n",
    "other neighborhoods in North York, Toranto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of people are migrating to various states of Canada and needed lots of research for good neiborhood \n",

    "This project is for those people who are looking for better neighborhoods to ease of accessing to Cafe, \n",
    "School, Super market, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, like minded people, etc.\n",

    "This Project also aims to create an analysis of features for a people migrating to Canada to search a best neighborhood \n",
    "as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include crime rates in neighborhood, better schools in neighborhood.\n",

    "It will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place \n",

    "Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined. \n",

    "and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n",

    "*Clustering Approach:\n",
    "To compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, \n",
    "and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city. \n",
    "To be able to do that, we need to cluster data with the help of \n",

    "-XML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\n",
